# RasterGraphic in C

## Purpose
holds the data of a raster graphic application (there is no actual graphics in the assignment) using a forward list (aka singly-linked list) in dynamic memory for its data.



The RasterGraphic is a series of GraphicElements held in a forward list. 
When the list runs it displays the details of each GraphicElement at intervals 
of 1 second using the system clock (you are given the code for this).
You can:
 add a new GraphicElement to the RasterGraphic at a position selected by the user,
 delete the first GraphicElement in the list,
 report the RasterGraphic to show the list of GraphicElement details one after 
another at 1 second intervals (code supplied),
quit leaving no allocated dynamic memory (i.e. no memory leak),
